//singly and doubly linked list
//issues with arrays -> performance and cost of space and time
//issues with hash table -> not ordered


// what is a linked list?
// A singly list contains a set of nodes (two nodes -> value and a pointer) 
// first node is head and last node is tail pointing to null
// const basket =['apples','grapes','pears']

// pseudo code for ll : apples -> grapes -> PerformanceServerTiming
// apples
// 8947 -- > grapes
//           8742----->pears
//                     ----->>> null
